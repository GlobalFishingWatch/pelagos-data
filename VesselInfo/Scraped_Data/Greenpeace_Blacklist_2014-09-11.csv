Reason for blacklisting: ICCAT Recommendation [03-04] relating to Mediterranean swordfish prohibits the use of driftnets for fisheries of large pelagics in the Mediterranean Sea. It is the responsibility of all ICCAT Contracting Parties to enforce this Recommendation and adopt a specific
management plan in order to protect the stock of swordfish in the Mediterranean Sea and sustain this fishery. This continued illegal activity should have come to an end when the European Union banned the use of driftnets for catching a wide range of pelagic fishes.

Reason for blacklisting: Kiribati fisheries officer Taratau Kirata explains the captain of Fong Seong 779 purse seiner failed to use the English language when logging and also failed to present the vessel’s operation license when inspected, last Sunday, near Nonouti Island, in Central Kiribati.
“Fong Seong 779 is licensed to fish in our waters, there’s no doubts about that,” Kirata said. “But the arrest was made  in accordance with the Rukuruku Operation  declaration.
“When the log book was inspected, it didn't show the entry date, it’s written in Taiwanese and two days of activities were not entered.”
The Kiribati Maritime Fisheries Enforcement Committee, which decides on the amount of fine to be imposed for foreign boats caught fishing illegally inside Kiribati waters, fined the Taiwanese boat US$100,000.

The vessel targets tuna species under the mandate of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. Under Mozambican fisheries legislation, fishing vessels are obliged to carry onboard a fishing licence for Mozambique’s waters, to provide detailed data on catch aboard the vessel upon entry and exit of the EEZ. Failure to have the license aboard the vessel prior to fishing and lack of a declaration of fish on board the vessel as it enters Mozambique’s EEZ are considered to be a serious infractions.
